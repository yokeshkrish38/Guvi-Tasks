Jenkins was deployed on AWS EC2 and integrated with GitHub using webhooks. A freestyle job was configured to automatically trigger builds on every commit, clone the repository, and execute the build script. The initial build completed successfully, proving end-to-end CI functionality. Subsequent builds were queued due to Jenkins TemporarySpaceMonitor enforcing /tmp space limits on a low-memory EC2 instance, which is a known limitation. This can be resolved by scaling the instance or using a build agent.
